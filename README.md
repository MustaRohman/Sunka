How to use server:

* Install node for your local machine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* Open a terminal and run `cd path/to/the/project`
* Call `npm install` - The installation should come with npm. If it does not, refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm for more help
* Call `ifconfig` on Linux/OSx and see your local address/inet address in the wlan network card (e.g. 192.168.... or 10.1....)
